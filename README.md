# Startup

## Elevator Pitch
For my startup, I want to create a website to display my video editing and programming skills. This will be a platform to connect me with people who are in a programming class or starting their own company/business. In essence, this startup will be a startup for other startups. I will edit and/or teach how I am able to do what I do.
